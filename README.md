This repository contains the code for CNNCS introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03307">"Cell Detection with Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Compressed Sensing"</a> (now submitted to IEEE Trans. on Image Processing) by Yao Xue, Nilanjan Ray, Judith Hugh, Gilbert Bigras

# Introduction
The proposed detection framework consists of three components: (1) cell location encoding phase using random projections, (2) a CNN-based regression model to capture the relationship between a cell microscopy image and the encoded signal, and (3) decoding phase for detection.

During training, the ground truth location of cells is indicated by a pixel-wise binary annotation map $B$. We propose a cell location encoding scheme, which converts cell location from pixel space representation $B$ to compressed signal representation $y$. Probably in the simplest form, this encoding may consist of reshaping the sparse matrix $B$ into a sparse vector $f$ by row or column major fashion. Then, $f$ is multiplied by a sensing matrix (usually, a random Gaussian matrix) to form a compressed and encoded vector $y$. The encoding scheme can also be more sophisticated as discussed later. Then, each training pair, consisting of a cell microscopy image and the signal $y$, trains a CNN to work as a multi-label regression model. We employ the Euclidean loss function during training, because it is often more suitable for regression. Image rotations may be performed on the training sets for the purpose of data augmentation as well as making the system more robust to rotations. During testing, the trained network is responsible for outputting an estimated signal $\hat{y}$ for each test image. After that, a decoding scheme is designed to predict the cell location by performing $L_1$ minimization recovery on the estimated signal $\hat{y}$, with the known sensing matrix.
